    <h1>AppTame User Manual</h1>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 1: Authorize Family Controls</h2>
        <p>Welcome to AppTame! The first step is to grant the app permission to interact with the Screen Time API. This screen provides instructions for setting up Screen Time on a parent's device if you haven't already. Once ready, tap the "Authorize Family Controls" button.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 2: Allow Access to Screen Time</h2>
        <p>After tapping the authorize button, your device will ask for confirmation. This is a standard iOS security prompt. Tap "Allow with iCloud Sign-in" to proceed. This gives AppTame the necessary permissions to manage restrictions.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 3: Confirmation</h2>
        <p>This screen confirms that AppTame has been successfully approved to access and manage Screen Time settings on this device. Tap "Done" to continue to the next step.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 4: Set Your Passcode</h2>
        <p>To prevent unauthorized changes, AppTame is protected by a passcode. On this screen, please set a secure 6-digit passcode that will be used to access the app's settings and main features.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 5: Create a New Routine</h2>
        <p>A "Routine" is a set of rules for blocking specific apps and categories. From the main screen, you can create a new routine. Give your routine a descriptive name (e.g., "Homework Time," "Bedtime") and then tap "Select Apps" to configure which applications will be restricted.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 6: Select Apps and Categories to Block</h2>
        <p>Here you can choose which apps and categories to block during your routine. You can block entire categories like "Social," "Games," or "Entertainment," or you can expand the categories to select or deselect individual apps. When you are finished, tap "Save".</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 7: Access the Weekly Schedule</h2>
        <p>After creating one or more routines, navigate to the "Schedules" tab. This screen shows a view of the entire week. Tap on any day to begin scheduling a routine for that day.</p>
        <img src="images/7 create schedules.png" alt="Weekly schedule screen">
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 8: Schedule Your Routine</h2>
        <p>On this screen, you can assign a routine to a specific time block. Select one of your previously created routines from the list, then set the "Start Time" and "End Time" for when the restrictions should be active. Tap "Add" to save it to the weekly schedule.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 9: Manually Stop a Routine</h2>
        <p>If you need to temporarily disable the currently active routine, you can do so from the "Schedules" tab. The "Stop Current Routine" button at the bottom of the screen will immediately lift all restrictions until the next scheduled routine begins.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Managing Your Passcode: Resetting</h2>
        <p>From the app's settings (gear icon), you can change your passcode at any time. The "Reset Passcode" option will guide you through setting a new one.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Managing Your Passcode: Recovery</h2>
        <p>If you forget your AppTame passcode, you can recover it. The app provides a "Passcode Recovery" option that uses the device's main Screen Time passcode for authentication. This ensures that only an authorized user can reset the app's passcode.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Disabling or Removing AppTame</h2>
        <p>If you wish to disable or uninstall AppTame, you must first revoke its permissions. Go to your device's Settings > Screen Time. Scroll down to "APPS WITH SCREEN TIME ACCESS" and tap on "AppTame". Toggle the switch to off. After doing this, you can safely delete the app from the device.</p>
