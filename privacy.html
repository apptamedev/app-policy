    <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <p>AppTame is built from the ground up with privacy in mind. We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal data, including but not limited to:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>All processing and monitoring performed using these frameworks happen <strong>entirely on your device</strong>. The information never leaves your phone and is never shared with us or any third party.</p>

    <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
    <p>AppTame offers premium features via in-app purchases. All transactions are processed securely by the Apple App Store. We do not collect, receive, or store any payment details. Your purchase information is managed directly by Apple and is subject to Apple's privacy policies and terms.</p>

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>Our app is designed to be used by parents to manage their children's screen time. We do not collect any personal information from children. All configuration and usage data remains on the user's device.</p>
